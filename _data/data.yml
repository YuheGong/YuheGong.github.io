  summary: |
    __Robot Manipulation and Human Robot Interaction__
    
    I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the University of Nottingham
    starting from October 2023, under the supervision of Dr. Luis Figueredo. 
    My PhD topic is robotic control, manipulation, and physical 
    human-robot interaction. I am interested in geometric methods for 
    intelligent robots, focusing on developing mathematical frameworks 
    that enable robots to operate in a natural, efficient, and comfortable manner.
